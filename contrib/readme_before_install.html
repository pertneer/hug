	You must first create a new "hidden" group. The id of this new group must be set in install_mod.xml before installing with automod to save you a lot of time unless this is the first group added on a new install of phpBB3.
	
	<br /><br />This mod will allow you to hide a user from the teams page, the memberlist, and from anyone viewing the profile. This is helpful when creating bots that no one needs to be able to see other than posts.
	Here are a couple of screen shots to understand what will do if the default admin user is added to this group and it is the default group for this user.<br />
